Personal Portfolio Website

Hello! This is my personal website where I have displayed my skills in web design using elements from HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

This is my first project, utilizing fundamental skills of source control and file integration. You will see that I have used knowledge of web design, spacing and organization into the website.

I also challenged myself by integrated OpenAI's CHATGPT API key/token into the website which was very challenging, but yet quite fruitful.
